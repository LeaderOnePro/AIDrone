# DeepDrone

A drone chat agent for drone analytics and operations, built on the smolagents framework with DroneKit integration for real drone control. It uses the DeepSeek API for natural language understanding and mission generation.

## Features

- **Drone Chat**: Interact with a drone assistant through a chat interface powered by DeepSeek.
- **Visualizations**: Generate flight paths and sensor readings visualizations.
- **Maintenance Recommendations**: Get maintenance suggestions based on flight hours.
- **Mission Planning**: Generate mission plans for various drone operations.
- **Real Drone Control**: Connect to and control real drones using DroneKit.
  - Take off and land
  - Navigate to GPS coordinates
  - Return to home
  - Execute waypoint missions
  - Monitor battery and location

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LeaderOnePro/deepdrone.git
    cd deepdrone
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Set up your API Key**:
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your DeepSeek API key:
    ```
    DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
    ```
4.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

## Using DroneKit Integration

The DroneKit integration allows you to control drones running ArduPilot or PX4 firmware.

### Simulation

To test the drone control features in a simulated environment:

1.  Install the ArduPilot SITL simulator (follow instructions at the [ArduPilot dev guide](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/setting-up-sitl-on-linux.html)).
2.  Start a simulated drone: `sim_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter --console --map`
3.  Connect to the simulator from the DeepDrone chat interface by typing: `Connect to simulator` or `connect_to_real_drone('udp:127.0.0.1:14550')`.

### Real Drone Connection

To connect to a real drone:

1.  Ensure your drone is running ArduPilot or PX4 firmware.
2.  Connect your drone to your computer.
3.  Use natural language commands in the DeepDrone chat interface. For example:
    - "Connect to drone at `tcp:192.168.1.1:5760`"
    - "Connect to drone using USB at `/dev/ttyACM0`" (for Linux)
    - "Connect to the drone at `COM4`" (for Windows)

Once connected, you can control the drone with commands like:
- "Take off to 10 meters"
- "Fly to latitude 37.7749, longitude -122.4194, altitude 30 meters"
- "Return to home"
- "Land now"

### Troubleshooting

-   **`collections.MutableMapping` error**: If you encounter this error, especially on Python 3.10+, run the included patch script: `python dronekit_patch.py`. This script resolves a compatibility issue in the DroneKit library.
-   **Connection refused error**: Ensure the drone or simulator is powered on and the connection string is correct.
-   **Import errors**: Verify that all dependencies are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
-   **Permission errors**: For USB connections on Linux, you may need to add your user to the `dialout` group (`sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`) or use `sudo` to run the application.

**IMPORTANT**: Always follow safety guidelines when operating real drones.

## Tech Stack

-   **smolagents** for agent functionality.
-   **DeepSeek API** (`deepseek-reasoner` model) for natural language understanding and code generation.
-   **DroneKit-Python** for real drone control.
-   **Streamlit** for the user interface.
-   **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** for data analysis and visualization.
